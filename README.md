CONTENT BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTERING RECOMMENDER ENGINE :
#FINAL CODE MODEL : 2_accomodation_recommender.ipynb file

     https://stayhub.animeshk.me/aboutus
-CODE'S FIRST PART IS A HOTEL RECOMMENDER ENGINE for europiean countries : NOT SELF MADE PROJECT

-CODE'S SECOND PART IS A Bhubaneswar PG recommender system  : SELF MADE PROJECT WORK

( data visualisation techniques have been used to show the patterns and to draw essenses from the Bhubaneswar PG dataset(using matplotlib and sns) and for the hotel dataset ),
in ways of scatter plot and bar graph)

FOR SECOND PART OF CODE : Accomodation RECOMMENDER : Bhubaneswar PG recommendations based on user preferences: 

1)CURATION OF DATASET 
    1.1) MAIN DATASET THAT WAS WEB SCRAPPED :  NOT PROCESSED : ORIGINAL WEB SCRAPPED DATA : PG_DATA CSV FILE
    1.2) TEST DATASET created as BOOK1.CSV USED TO SHOW RESULTS OF THE RECOMMENDER ENGINE
2)LOADING DATASET : EXPLORATION, PREPROCESSING, VISUALISATION ON BOOK1.CSV(TEST DATA)
3)FEATURE ENGINEERING
4)DIFFERENT TYPES OF RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHMS WERE TESTED (REJECTED ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTATION SHOWN IN LAST CELLS OF 2_ACCOMODATION_RECOMMENDER.ipynb file.
5)AFTER SELECTING COLLABORATIVE FILTERING AS FINAL SYSTEM ALGORITHM, 3 TYPES OF RECOMMENDER ENGINES BUILT :
      5.1)ONLY ADDRESS AS USER INPUT
      5.2) ADDRESS AND TYPE OF SHARING WANTED AS USER INPUT
      5.3) ADDRESS,SHARING TYPE,BUDGET AND DESCRIPTION USED AS USER INPUT .USING NLP SIMILARITY INDEX GENERATED FOR USER GIVEN DESCRIPTION WITH THE RECOMMENDED PGS.MODEL 
           DESIGNED TO SHOW RESULTS WITH THE HIGHER SIMILARITY INDEXED PGs FIRST .  
      5.5) POPULARITY BASED ENGINE BASED ON STAR RATING ALSO IMPLEMENTED     
           

 SO FINALLY , IT USES FEATURES LIKE ADDRESS, SHARING IN A PG, PRICE, RATING AND USER GIVEN DESCRIPTIONS TO RECOMMEND PG'S IN BHUBANESWAR.
SHOWS RESULTS BASED ON USER PREFERENCES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOWING WHAT IS THE SIMILARITY COUNT OF A PG WITH THE GIVEN USER DESCRIPTION.
THE PGS ARE SHOWN IN DESCENDING ORDER OF SIMILARITY.
